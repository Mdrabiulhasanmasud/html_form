        Life is a quality that distinguishes matter that has biological processes, 
         such as signaling and self-sustaining processes, from matter that does not,
         and is defined descriptively by the capacity for homeostasis, organisation,
         metabolism, growth, adaptation, response to stimuli, and reproduction. Many 
         philosophical definitions of living systems have been proposed, such as 
        self-organizing systems. Viruses in particular make definition difficult
        as they replicate only in host cells. Life exists all over the Earth in
        air, water, and soil, with many ecosystems forming the biosphere. Some of 
        these are harsh environments occupied only by extremophiles. Life has been 
        studied since ancient times, with theories such as Empedocles's materialism
        asserting that it was composed of four eternal elements, and Aristotle's hylomorphism
        asserting that living things have souls and embody both form and matter. Life originated 
        at least 3.5 billion years ago, resulting in a universal common ancestor. This evolved into
        all the species that exist now, by way of many extinct species, some of which have left traces
        as fossils. Attempts to classify living things, too, began with Aristotle. Modern classification
        began with Carl Linnaeus's system of binomial nomenclature in the 1740s
